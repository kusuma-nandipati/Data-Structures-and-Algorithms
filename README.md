# ðŸ“˜ DSA Notes and Assignments

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms** notes, assignments, and coding practice.  
It is a collection of important concepts, solved problems, and implementation codes in Python (and/or C++/Java).

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure
- `Notes/` â†’ Handwritten and digital notes  
- `Assignments/` â†’ College/online course assignments  
- `Codes/` â†’ Implementations of DSA topics (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, DP, etc.)

## ðŸš€ Topics Covered
- Arrays and Strings  
- Linked Lists  
- Stacks and Queues  
- Trees and Graphs  
- Sorting and Searching  
- Recursion and Backtracking  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Greedy Algorithms  
- Hashing  

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
- Build strong fundamentals in DSA  
- Practice competitive programming problems  
- Keep track of my learning journey
